# Introduction

-   Scientists have been studying the human coronavirus since its discovery in the 1960s

-   With the emergence of a new variant of coronavirus in 2019, it became important to devote a significant amount of time to reading and identifying relevant studies to better understand COVID-19

-   It is urgent to sort out important, effective, and meaningful information from large databases to guide scientific research and promote the proper control, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of COVID-19

# Topic Modeling

-   Topic modeling makes an excellent tool for discovery and helps to uncover evidence already present in the text

-   A topic can be defined as the main idea discussed in a text, i.e., the theme or subject of different granularities

-   There are no machine-readable annotations that can tell the topic modeling programs about the semantic meaning of the words in the text

-   It infers abstract topics based on similar patterns of word usage in each documents

# Need of the Study

This study will help to (i) determine the core topics published by which AIIMS, New Delhi researchers related to COVID-19, and (ii) visualize the results using a dashboard and storyboard

# Methodology

-   Data was retrieved from Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed databases for the query, "corona" OR "covid-19" OR "coronavirus" restricted to AIIMS, New Delhi

-   Search was performed in April 2021

-   Metadata for 853 studies were identified from all three databases which were then merged and removed for duplicates using the bibliometrix package in R

-   After the preliminary cleaning, a total of 388 publications were finalized for the period 2010-2021 from 199 journals for the study. The structural topic model was performed using stm package in R

## Core Topics (Continue)

T1 -- Respiratory Infection

T2 -- Drugs Trial and Effectiveness

T3 -- Lockdown in India

T4 -- Patient Care, Practice, and Management

T5 -- Behavioral Studies

T6 -- Mental Health

T7 -- Systematic Reviews and Metanalysis

T8 -- Guidelines to Perform Surgeries in COVID-19 Patients

T9 -- Statements and Recommendations

T10 -- Mortality

# Topic Correlation

# Visualization of Topics

-   Output of topic modeling is not entirely human-readable, and one way to understand the results is through visualization

-   Therefore, we constructed a storyboard and dashboard that is human-readable and easy to comprehend as well as interpret

## Dashboard

::: notes
When you click on the figure, a new window will open in your browser where you can interact and visualizes the changes by altering various parameters. Recommended settings are: X-axis = TI; Y-axis = topic of choice; Radius = topic chosen; Color = PY. The titles with topic proportion more than 0.50 (Y-axis) should be considered as the representative titles for that particular topic.

## Conclusion

-   Topic modeling and data visualization are critical for exploring and communicating information effectively and helping researchers to continue to progress

-   The study presents an overview of early studies of the COVID-19 crisis published from AIIMS, New Delhi at different scales including topic variation, and their inner interactions

-   It also identifies papers that are regarded as the cornerstones for different topics in the development of COVID-19 research published by AIIMS, New Delhi

## Conclusion (Continue) 

-   The results unveil the focus of scientific research, thereby giving deep insights into how the top Indian medical society contributes to combating the COVID-19 pandemic

-   The methodology from this study can be applied to trace the literature of any field on any topic of interest

-   This study can be used to analyze large datasets of COVID-19 literature to investigate and visualize the ongoing advancements of early scientific research on COVID-19 from the perspective of Artificial Intelligence

## Thank you!
